        <h4>The Realm of <b class="Redacted">REDACTED</b>; In the Beginning</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the beginning, <b class="Redacted">REDACTED</b> was a world like
          any other, however this was destined to change when calamity struck
          nearly causing an apocalyptical event. The only way to prevent this
          was the System. This System is named Yggdrasil and was put in place at
          the core of the world to save it, so that those that inhabit it and
          those that come to inhabit it can all live and thrive. As the years
          became decades became centuries, the old civilization came to an end
          as the world came to a soft reset, the old buildings being buried or
          lost to the sands of time. The only remnant now is the Labyrinth, a
          planet wide dungeon. As elvin life has gone on, they were joined by
          humans, dwarves, and other races that came to inhabit
          <b class="Redacted">REDACTED</b>.
          <b class="Redacted">REDACTED's</b> main continent is Sladridor, named
          for the old elvin kingdom that once encompassed the continent. The
          Elves of Sladridor came <b>before</b> all other races were introduced
          to <b class="Redacted">REDACTED</b>, in fact the Kingdom of Sladridor
          was taken down by an alliance of humans, dwarves and some others
          seeking fair and equal treatment, after which the alliance bided
          Sladridor into smaller kingdoms. The only remaining of those original
          kingdoms being that of Dwarga-ur, the dwarven kingdom under the
          Spine'ed Mountains.
